* Hello, I'm danklovic and I'm somewhat new to coding, I'm currently interested in Python 👋

* So I got interested with Python after learning tutorials about discord.py to make my own Discord Bots, I'm still learning them though 📘

* In future I might learn PyGame too, with my moderate Pixel Art Skills. 📝

* TL:DR - Beginner to Python and learning to make Discord Bots 🚞

* Thank you 🙏
